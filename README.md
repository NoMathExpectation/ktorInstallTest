First you need to compile this project to jar using `mirai/buildPlugin` Gradle task, and you will find the built jar in `build/mirai` folder.

This project is a plugin of [Mirai Console](https://github.com/mamoe/mirai). So you will need it to load this plugin. You can download Mirai Console installer [here](https://github.com/iTXTech/mcl-installer/releases).
